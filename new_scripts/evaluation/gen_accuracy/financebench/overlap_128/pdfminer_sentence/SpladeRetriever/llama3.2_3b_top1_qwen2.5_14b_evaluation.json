Decrease in research, development and related expenses due to continued investment in R&D activities.\n\nThese factors contributed to a 5.4% decrease in operating income margin as of FY2022 compared to the same period last year.\n\nRegarding whether operating margin is a useful metric for a company like 3M, it depends on the context.

This suggests that the company's revenues are influenced by fluctuations in demand, which is a characteristic of cyclically sensitive industries.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that Boeing reports significant losses in certain years (e.g., 2020, 2021) and profits in others (e.g., 2019), indicates that the company's business is subject to seasonal or cyclical variations. This pattern is consistent with industries such as aerospace, which are often affected by factors like economic downturns, changes in government spending, and shifts in consumer demand.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, it can be inferred that Boeing's business is subject to cyclicality.",

Additionally, the company has entered into fixed dollar ASRs with Citibank and Barclays Bank PLC, which will result in the issuance of additional shares representing up to 43.4 million shares.\n\nThis suggests that CVS Health is actively using its capital to repurchase its own shares, indicating a high level of capital intensity.",
