Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Under the section \"Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,\" it is mentioned that during the year ended December 31, 2022, CVS Health repurchased an aggregate of 34.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $3.5 billion.\n\nThis significant amount of share repurchases indicates a substantial outflow of cash from the company's operations to purchase its own shares, which is a characteristic of capital-intensive businesses. The fact that the company has authorized multiple share repurchase programs and has entered into fixed-dollar ASRs with banks suggests that it intends to continue investing in its common stock.\n\nWhile the context documents do not provide explicit information on the company's capital structure or debt levels, the significant amount of cash spent on share repurchases implies a high level of capital expenditure.
