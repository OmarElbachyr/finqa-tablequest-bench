| In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08. The guidance requires entities to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. | 11/1/2021                                                                                                                             | Verizon has elected to early adopt this Topic effective November 1, 2021, and has retroactively applied this guidance to all business combinations that took place on or after January 1, 2021. The adoption resulted in the recognition of contract liabilities at amounts consistent with those recorded by TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone) immediately before the acquisition date. The adoption had no impact on other business combinations in 2021. See Note 3 for additional information on the acquisition of Tracfone. |

| 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842), Lessors-Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments                                                                                                                                                         | The amendments in this update affect lessors with lease contracts that (1) have variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate and (2) would have resulted in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement if classified as sales- type or direct financing. Lessors should classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate as an operating lease if both of the following criteria are met: (a) The lease would have been classified as a sales-type lease or a direct financing lease in accordance with the classification criteria in paragraphs 842-10-25-2 through 25-3, (b) The lessor would have otherwise recognized a day-one loss. This update could be applied either (1) retrospectively to leases that commenced or were modified on or after the adoption of Update 2016-02 or (2) prospectively to leases that commence or are modified on or after the date that an entity first applies the amendments. | January 1, 2022                                                           | The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis and it did not have a material impact on the financial statements.                                                                                                                                           |
| 2020-06, Debt - Debt with conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Equity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Equity's Own Equity | The amendments in this update affect entities that issue convertible instruments and/or contracts indexed to and potentially settled in an entity's own equity. The new ASU eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models for convertible instruments. It also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity's own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions. In addition, the new guidance modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | January 1, 2022                                                           | The Company adopted this standard on a fully retrospective basis and its adoption resulted in a $13 million increase to Preferred Stock and a corresponding decrease to Additional paid-in capital.

These amendments are effective for a limited period of time (March 12, 2020 - December 31, 2024).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024 | The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis and it did not have a material impact on the financial statements.                                                                                                                                           |

| 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers | This update is to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the following: 1. Recognition of an acquired contract liability 2. Payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. An entity that early adopts in an interim period should apply the amendments (1) retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of early application and (2) prospectively to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of initial application. | For fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years.                                                                                                                             | The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on its consolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2022-04,Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 450- 50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations               | This update is to provide additional information and disclosures about an entity's use of supplier finance programs to see how these programs will affect an entity's working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. Entities that use supplier finance programs as the buyer party should disclose (1) the key terms of the payment terms and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided and (2) the unpaid amount outstanding, a description of where those obligations are presented on the balance sheet, and a rollforward of those obligations during the annual period. In each interim reporting period, the buyer must disclose the unpaid amount outstanding at the end of the interim period.                                                                                     | For fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. | The ASU only requires disclosures related to the Company's supplier finance programs and does not affect the recognition, measurement, or presentation of supplier finance program obligations on the balance sheet or cash flow statement. The Company expects to adopt the new disclosure requirements in the first quarter of 2023, except for the annual requirement to disclose rollforward information, which the Company expects to adopt and present prospectively beginning in the 2024 annual financial statements. |

The expedients elected must be applied for all eligible contracts or transactions, with the exception of hedging relationships, which can be applied on an individual basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 | Prospective for contract modifications and hedging relationships; applied as of January 1, 2020.                                                                                                                                                                    | The standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. |
| Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes                                 | The guidance removes exceptions related to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for changes in ownership of a foreign subsidiary or equity method investment, and the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when the year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss. The guidance adds requirements to reflect changes to tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period in which the changes were enacted, to recognize franchise or other similar taxes that are partially based on income as an income-based tax and any incremental amounts as non-income-based tax, and to evaluate when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which the book goodwill was originally recognized and when it should be considered a separate transaction. | January 1, 2021                          | Modified retrospective for amendments related to changes in ownership of a foreign subsidiary or equity method investment; Modified retrospective or retrospective for amendments related to taxes partially based on income; Prospective for all other amendments. | The standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. |

| Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity       | Simplification of financial reporting associated with accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity's own equity. The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. This will result in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract. Earnings per share ('EPS') calculations have been simplified for certain instruments.                                                                                                                      | January 1, 2022                           | Either modified retrospective or fully retrospective | The Company anticipates the adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. |

| Growth from PC1 primarily reflecting manufacturing of legacy Upjohn products for Viatris under manufacturing and supply agreements and certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech.

| Lower revenues for Chantix/Champix, Enbrel and Sutent: • The decrease for Chantix/Champix was driven by the voluntary 2021 and the ongoing global pause in shipments of Chantix                                                                                                                                                                                 |             |         |                 |
| • The decrease for Enbrel internationally primarily reflects continued biosimilar competition, which is expected to continue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |             |         |                 |
| • The decrease for Sutent primarily reflects lower volume demand in the U.S. resulting from its loss of exclusivity in August 2021, as well as continued erosion as a result of increased competition in certain international developed markets                                                                                                                | (869)       | (501)   | (368)           |
